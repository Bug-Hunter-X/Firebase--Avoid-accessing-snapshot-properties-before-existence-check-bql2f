This repository contains a demonstration of a common error when using the Firebase SDK in JavaScript.  The `bug.js` file shows how attempting to access snapshot properties before checking `snapshot.exists` leads to errors.  The corrected code in `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the proper way to avoid this issue. This is crucial to avoid unexpected app crashes and runtime errors in Firebase applications.
